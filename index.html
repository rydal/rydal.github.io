For the 2017 year I was student rep for my course. 
In this capacity I created and ran homework club for the advanced computer science stream to tutor the standard and 
 conversion streams. I accrued over 100 hours to the student Union running events for postgraduates.

A program to return a successful or failed HTTP web qode based on the status of a server.<br>
 Some load balancers poll to see if i a page is running, what if the web based server is not crashing but giving wrong information?<br>
 Obviously a sysadmin could run a check scripe but that will not interface with a simple load balancer. <br>
 This program, written in C++, will return a successful HTTP code if the test script runs ok, and an error code 500 if the script fails to run successfully. <br>
