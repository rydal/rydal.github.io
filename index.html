    <A HREF="https://github.com/rydal/overground" target="_blank"><b>Overground</b></A><br>

    <A HREF="https://github.com/rydal/broken" target="_blank"><b>Broken</b></A>
    A program to return a successful or failed HTTP web code based on the status of a server.
    Some load balancers poll to see if i a page is running, what if the web based server is not crashing but giving wrong information?  Obviously a sysadmin could run a check script but that will not interface with a simple load balancer.  This program, written in C++, will return a successful HTTP code 200 if the test script runs OK, and an error code 500 if the script fails to run successfully. <br>
    <b>Extra curricular:</b>For the 2017 year I was student rep for my course. In this capacity I created and ran homework club for the advanced computer science stream to tutor the standard and conversion streams. I accrued over 100 hours with the student Union running events for postgraduate students.
