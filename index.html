        I have now finished my Master's degree at Kent University.<br>
        Grades at 61% all told with Internet of things to complete and dissertation to be graded. A merit so far. I will graduate in June of 2019. <br>
        For the 2017 year I was student rep for my course. In this capacity I created and ran homework<br>
        club for the advanced computer science stream to tutor the standard and conversion streams. I accrued over 100 hours with the student Union running events for postgraduate students.<br>
        Other education includes Open University from 2011-2014, for which i got a 2:2.<br>
        I am also an accredited Linux Professional Institute Linux engineer, details of which are here:<br>

        This was over 6K lines of code. <br>
        It's a platform for contributing Linux device driver configurations with the back-end written in Java and the front end written in C++. The front-end installs said drivers using a graphical interface.<br>
        It is a proof of concept<br>
<br>
        Apps:<br>
        A website for sharing conatct information over web links and QR Codes:
        <A HREF="https://likeme.mx/link/sample">Likeme.mx QR sample</A><br>
        <A HREF="https://likeme.mx/sample">Likeme.mx user information sample</A><br>
        
        
        Submissions for a web standard for accessing your location with poor / non existent GPS coverage.<br>
        <A HREF="https://github.com/rydal/underground">Underground</A>
        is a Java back-end for ascertaining the location of a user based on their public IP address using a Wi-Fi connection.<br>
        <A HREF="https://github.com/rydal/overground">Overground</A>
        is a C++ application for relaying GPS location over a Wi-Fi link.<br>
<br>
        It is hoped these will become ratified web standards.<br>
<br>
        A program to return a successful or failed HTTP web code based on the status of a server.<br>
        Some load balancers poll to see if i a page is running, what if the web based server is not crashing but giving wrong information?<br>
        Obviously a sysadmin could run a check script but that will not interface with a simple load balancer. <br>
        This program, written in C++, will return a successful HTTP code if the test script runs OK, and an error code 500 if the script fails to run successfully. <br>

        <br>
        I also know Web based technologies.<br>
<br>
        My skill set: Linux, Java,MySQL,C++, HTML,CSS,C++, and JavaScript.<br>
